2. Open the ``index.html`` with a web browser (such as Chrome)
3. Bam! Now you're able to use it

## Usage

Play it as you would normally would play Tick Tack Toe, try to be the first to get 3 in a row. 

Remember, 3 of the same color in any direction counts as a win!

To turn the cube, just click outside of it and move your mouse. If you want to zoom in/out, use your mouse scroller.
